The LMEC digital collections live at <https://collections.leventhalmap.org>. As a Digital Commonwealth partner institution, you can also find any of our items online at <https://digitalcommonwealth.org>.

The over 11,000 items in our digital collections can be queried by a few different, related methods: JSON API, IIIF API, and scraping. As Digital Commonwealth partners, all of our collections adhere to [Digital Commonwealth's API specifications](https://digitalcommonwealth.org).

### Using the notebooks

You can run these notebooks in [Binder](https://mybinder.org), or you can clone the repo and run them locally through something like Anaconda.
